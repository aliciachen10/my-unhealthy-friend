# my unhealthy friend - a good application for dieting badly 
the best anti - my fitness pal app of all time. My Unhealthy Friend allows a user to find dietary options that fit their lifestyle and personal preferences. It uses activity data and user supplied preferences in order to provide possible meal choices, keeping within calorie expenditure. 

## how to use the app
This app is deployed on Heroku [here](https://murmuring-depths-69285.herokuapp.com/) feel free to [contact us](mailto:aliciachen10 at gmail dot com) with questions, comments, concerns, or bugs. Alternatively, you can also:
1. git clone this repo
2. npm install in your integrated terminal
3. mysql -u root -p 
4. source db/schema.sql
5. npm run seed 
6. node server.js 
7. open up localhost:3001 in your browser

## motivation for development
Many applications exist today that allow a user to track what they eat and workouts, with the seeming purpose of tracking and maintaining a calorie deficit. However, many people workout with the intention of making a larger variety of dietary choices available to them. Our application allows a user to track workouts and caloric expenditure, with the intent of using this data to confirm what they’re able to consume with “zero guilt.” We seek to give a user options that they can “get away with” health wise, as opposed to giving options that are specifically “best” for a user’s diet at any given point. In doing so, we hope to provide a more fun way for a user to find manageable dietary choices.

## technologies used
We used bootstrap for styling, expressJS and nodeJS for backend and frontend, MVC for orgainzing our files, and ORM - Sequelize specifically - for creating and seeding our MySQL database. We also utilized MomentJS for formatting dates.
